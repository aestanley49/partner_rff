## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Set up file structure
```{r, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#Github file set up
DataSource <- "./data" # input raw dataset goes here
output.dir <-"./output" # output dataset writes to here
functions.dir <- "./functions" # directory for functions 

#Functions to read in 
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

load in data 
```{r setup data, echo = FALSE}
#final cleaned counts are in a column of this data set --> this is the response variable
partnercount <- read.csv(paste0(DataSource,"/cleanedcountofpartners.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
partnercount <- partnercount %>%  as_tibble() #now can use stringr packages 
partnercount <- partnercount %>%  ##cleaning/reformating colunm names --> default is lower_case_snake
                  clean_names()
#dataset that tyler sent, contains a number of predictors 
tdata <- read.csv(paste0(DataSource,"/precluded_species_data2.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
tdata <- tdata %>%  as_tibble() #now can use stringr packages 
tdata <- tdata %>%  ##cleaning/reformating colunm names --> default is lower_case_snake
                  clean_names()
#information for categorizing agreements
agree <- read_excel(paste0(DataSource,"/AS8_codingdata.xlxs", "total data")) ##can't specify a page with this file set up so loading in from my directory 
agree <- read_excel("/usr/local/bin/store/partner_rff/data/AS8_codingdata.xlsx", "totaldata")
```

Combining two datasets and limiting to predictors of interest 
```{r combining}
#View(partnercount) looking at data
partnercount <- partnercount[, c(2,3,11)] #only selected rows with species names and the total counts
tdata <- tdata[,c(2,5,20,6,21,17)]
# proxys being used in analysis and corresponding column number
  # range size --> area c20 
  # species group --> taxa c6
  # area weighted footprint --> c21 ?have options
  # type of threat --> c17
  # have 4 other issues to address --> may need to come back to this list 
#combine two datasets
#First need to have the names columns be the same (tdata currently has x_x at end) - actually going to try without
tdata <- tdata %>% rename(scientific_name = scientific_name_x_x)

combo <- partnercount %>% full_join(tdata,
                                    by ="scientific_name")
#no regression data on 4 of the species that we have partner counts for
#Removing the data that there are no partner counts for 
combo <- combo[-which(is.na(combo$total)),] #removed all rows that had na's for partners aka the ones with no information
#removing extra common name colum 
combo <- combo[,-c(4)]

```

Need some way to standardize number of partners per agreeement (exact number of even weighting?)
need to create columns with HCP | CCA | CCAA | Other
```{r agreements}
agree <- agree[,c(1,2,8,15)]
agree <- agree[-which(agree$`type of agreements (source of information)` == "None"),]
##creating function to check agreement years and then will load in here 

```

Predictor: range size 
```{r area}
#distribution of area
hist(combo$area_x, xlab ="area (m^2)", breaks = 30)
#response variable or total number of partners
plot(combo$area_x, combo$total)
#predictor: taxa

#predictor: human footprint
plot(combo$area_x, combo$area_weighted_footprint_2009)
#predictor: threat type 



```

Predictor: taxa 
```{r taxa}
#distribution of taxa
taxa <- table(combo$species_group_x_x)
barplot(table(combo$species_group_x_x), las=2, space=1.1,cex.names = .4)
#going to change code to do 1 for flowering plants and 0 for all else
#create new column and fill it
taxa <- c(0)
combo <- add_column(combo, taxa)
which(combo$species_group_x_x == "Flowering Plants")
combo[which(combo$species_group_x_x == "Flowering Plants"),8] <- 1
(table(combo$taxa, combo$total))

#charasmatic mega funa (how define?)

```

Predictor: human footprint 
```{r footprint}
#distribution of human footprint 
hist(combo$area_weighted_footprint_2009, xlab ="human footprint value (weighted per county", breaks = 15)
#response variable or total number of partners
plot(combo$area_weighted_footprint_2009, combo$total)
#predictor: taxa

#predictor: human footprint
plot(combo$area_weighted_footprint_2009, combo$area_x)
#predictor: threat type 
```

Predictor: number of overlapping ranges (Need to bring in from ArcGIS)
```{r}

```

Predictor: threats data 
```{r threats}
#cleaning by replacing and with a comma
combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x[17] <- "Habitat modification, species-species interaction" #added comma
combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x[18] <- "Habitat modification, pollution, species-species interaction" #added comma
combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x[26] <- "Habitat modification, species-species interactions, demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity" #added comma
combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x[36] <- "Habitat modification, demographic stochasticity"
combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x[39] <- "Habitat modification, species-species interaction, demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity"
combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x[44] <-"Habitat modification, species-species interaction" #added comma
combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x[53] <- "Habitat modification, species-species interactions, demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity"

 #distribution of threats
threats <- table(combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x)
barplot(threats, las=2, space=1.1,cex.names = .4)
 ##need to clean difference between none and None? (will check with tyler but as of now merge)
combo[which(combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x == "none"),7] <- "None"
#going to change code to do 1 for flowering plants and 0 for all else
hthreat <- c(0) #create new column and fill it
combo <- add_column(combo, hthreat)
which(combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x == "Habitat modification")
combo[which(combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x == "Habitat modification"),9] <- 1
  #this only changes the cells that have habitat modification as the only threat, not ones with multiple threats
#count the toal number of threats for each species  
noneaszero <- combo[-which(combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x == "None"),]
noneaszero$totalthreat <- str_count(noneaszero$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x, ",") +1  #because partners are seperated by a , need to add 1 to each
#then rejoin with original dataset
## remove all datacolumns in noneaszeros besides name and counts
noneaszero <- noneaszero[,-c(3:9)]
combo <- combo %>%  #combine original and checked into new data frame
  full_join(noneaszero, 
            by = c("scientific_name", "common_name"))
#add the "Nones" into totalthreat column 
combo[which(combo$threats_addressed_by_conservation_x_x == "None"),10] <- 0

#every column with multiple threats includes habitat as a threat, but because this is in a string it isn't being counted by hthreat column. Going to add count now 
combo[which(combo$totalthreat > 1),9] <- 1
```
