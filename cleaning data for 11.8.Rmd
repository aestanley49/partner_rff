## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



Load in data

```{r}
getwd()
setwd("/Users/annabellestanley/Desktop/Fall 2019/RFF part 2")
###telling computer which folder csv or excel files are in. Note have to specify that folder

tpc <- read.csv("data11.8a.csv") #total partner counts
sal <- read.csv("data11.8b.csv") #salafsky partner actions
##two data sets with names assigned
##note that different csv files from 10.30 (information chanced - see notes AS8)
```

Data cleaning: Salafsky info 
  Need to rename columns bc super long
  Also deleted irrelivant columns 

```{r}
#deleting columns that won't be used in data set 
sal$X <- NULL #empty column, nothing even here
sal$doc.link <- NULL #document links 

#renaming columns
colnames(sal)[colnames(sal)=="partner.in.agreement"] <- "partner"
  #note, most column names were manually chnaged in csv file
```


Data cleaning: Salafsky info 
  Fill in 1s and 0s for partner actions columns X1:funding 

```{r}
head(sal$X1) #come up as blanks 
is.na(sal) #no NAs in dataset 
    #Q: is this because the dataset has been read in as a string/something that doesn't produce NAs?
str(sal)
    #all read is a factor bc #automatically turning character vectors into factors.
#checking to see if blanks in this section of dataset come up as NA

as.numeric(sal$X1) #so each box has corresponding numeric value where empty = 1; anything higher has count 
as.character(sal$X2)
as.factor(sal$X2)

#unsure what to do/relevance with structure information 

#try loading data as character strings then chnage to numeric to see if converts to 1s or 0s 
test <- read.csv("data11.8b.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
View(test)
head(as.numeric(test$X1))

?ifelse


#make subsection matrix for all columns want to change as trial
  #if this works, will need to figure out how to readd later 
subsal<- sal
subsal$agreement.number <- subsal$partner <- subsal$Programatic <- subsal$type.of.partners <- NULL
View(subsal)

as.numeric(subsal$X1)

##Loop attempt  1 
for(j in 1:ncol(subsal)){ #iterate across the columns of mat
  if (as.numeric(subsal$X1 == "")) { #
  print(0)
  }
  else {(as.numeric(subsal$X1 > 2))
  print(1)
  }
}
###code ran but didn't work 


##Loop attempt  2
for(j in 1:ncol(subsal)){ #iterate across the columns of mat
  if (as.numeric(subsal$X2 == "")) { #
  subsal$X2 <- 0
  }
  else {(as.numeric(subsal$X2 > 2))
  subsal$X2 <- 1
  }
}
  
##code is definetely not working


```


Data cleaning: Salafsky info 
  checking and correcting for spelling errors 
  This is probably a living code, where if one is found, change it here
  Unless there is a better way to do it?

```{r}
table(sal$partner)
?count
data.entry(sal)
```


Data cleaning: Both
  Check to see if number of partners in salafsky = number of partners in total count 
  Process:
    need to make new matrix that holds the count of each document 
  
```{r}
View(sal)

## Questions
  # how deal with multiple parter rows? 
```


```{r}
