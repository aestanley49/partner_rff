The state directors committed their agencies to development of a Swift Fox Conservation Strategy with specific objectives for conservation of the species and dedicated resources to achieve the strategy’s goals. The team was formed under the leadership of the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA). In 2005, the swift fox conservation effort was incorporated into WAFWA’s Grassland Initiative, which uses an ecosystem approach to species conservation and allows more direct coordination between WAFWA and the SFCT. The SFCT is led by representatives of the 10 state wildlife agencies and includes additional representation from federal agencies and the Canadian Swift Fox Recovery Team. Participating cooperators include interested tribes, conservation and zoological organizations, universities, and state and federal agencies. The SFCT has met nearly every year since its formation in meetings that are open to the public. Team meetings provide a forum for information exchange and discussion and for distribution of annual reports, which document progress by each partner toward CACS objectives.,pages 5-9,NA",NA,NA
