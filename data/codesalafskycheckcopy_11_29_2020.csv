Each landowner/manager will provide an annual update outlining the implementation of this CCA, summarizing the results thereof, and outlining any changes or improvements where needed: a. This report will be provided to the NBC Natural Resources staff by October 15; b. The NBC Natural Resources staff will consolidate these reports into one submission to the Service for review by November 15. 2. Cooperating agencies will establish and participate in a Brand’s Phacelia Working Group consisting of their staff (or designated representatives), the Service, and biologists involved in conducting surveys, if available. Working Group participants will meet annually to: a. provide site-specific updates on the status of the plants and habitat management; b. evaluate ongoing management strategies for Brand’s phacelia and assess the effectiveness of implementation of the Conservation Action Items to date; and c. discuss and develop additional management strategies that the landowners could choose to implement as part of an adaptive management approach, should management to date appear insufficient or should a different approach to management be indicated. - - - - - Agency-Specific Commitments::: Naval Base Coronado::: 5. Management in the INRMP will be designed to avoid actions which may cause a species to become threatened or endangered. In addition to those species listed as threatened or endangered under the Act, or that are candidates for such listing, the U.S. Navy has recognized the need to implement special management direction for other rare species on the lands it administers. 6. Fund weed control, dune restoration, and habitat enhancement on an annual basis to monitor and treat as needed any plant that poses a threat to the continued success of Brand’s phacelia. Invasive species funding will be targeted for the removal of iceplant to promote the expansion of Brand’s phacelia beyond the baseline population level in areas not used for training. 7. Monitor all known Brand’s phacelia populations every year for the duration of this agreement and monitor for new populations in suitable habitat areas [e.g., SSTC-South and Naval Outlying Landing Field Imperial Beach (NOLF IB)]. If the distribution of Brand’s phacelia expands beyond its current known distribution at NBC, additional occurrences will be managed to the extent feasible, in accordance with this CCA. 8. Ensure that mowing within occupied habitat at NAS North Island continues in a manner which minimizes effects to Brand’s phacelia. 9. To the greatest extent feasible, work with the Navy operators to conduct all activities associated with military operations (including maintenance) in a manner that minimizes adverse effects to existing populations and perhaps promotes Brand’s phacelia populations. The NBC Installation Botanist will: a. provide military operators and schedulers the most recent GIS layers for Brand’s phacelia distribution. When possible, plant locations will be considered in conducting training events; and b. coordinate with military operators to reduce the risk of invasion of nonnative plants and noxious weeds in Brand’s phacelia habitat areas. 10. To the greatest extent feasible, provide access and support studies/scientific research specific to the biology and ecology of Brand’s phacelia at NBC or off site. 11. Continue seed collection and offsite seed storage program. Storage program will be done by an entity experienced with maintaining seed repositories. 12. Monitor Brand’s phacelia occupied and adjacent habitat for invasive plants. Spraying in or near populations of Brand’s phacelia will be evaluated on a site-specific and herbicidedependent basis prior to application to alleviate negative impact to the species and its potential pollinators and non-target, native vegetation. 13. Monitor recreational impacts and the effects of public parking on the Brand’s phacelia population at SSTC-N Bayside. Signs, flagging, and other strategies to minimize disturbance from parking and public recreation will be implemented as necessary. 14. Monitor Brand’s phacelia at SSTC-N Bayside annually to assess whether ingress/egress of military users is affecting plants in this area. 15. If required, complete NEPA analysis for implementation of future projects in areas occupied by Brand’s phacelia. The NEPA process seeks to avoid and minimize effects to sensitive resources. The Service, cooperators, and public can review projects as a part of the NEPA process. 16. Notify Cooperating Agencies and/or the Working Group of future projects with the potential to affect Brand’s phacelia. MCB Camp Pendleton 17. Fund weed control, dune restoration, and habitat enhancement on an annual basis to treat, as needed, any plant that poses a threat to the continued success of Brand’s phacelia. Invasive species funding will targeted towards the removal of invasive nonnative forbs and invasive annual grasses and their thatch to improve habitat conditions for Brand’s phacelia. 18. Monitor the known Brand’s phacelia population every year for the duration of this agreement. 19. Inventory for new populations in suitable habitat areas in the lower Santa Margarita River. California State Parks 20. Provide annual invasive species control within areas that support Brand’s phacelia. Invasive plant control will consist of herbicide treatment or removal of iceplant. If monitoring data or data from working group suggests that Brand’s phacelia occurrences are in decline relative to increases in a specific invasive plant species, then those species will be treated intensively. Species to consider include European searocket, Saharan mustard, Oenothera laciniata (cutleaf evening-primrose), Emex spinosa (devil’s thorn), and annual grasses that produce heavy thatch (e.g., Bromus diandrus, Lolium perenne). If new occurrences of an invasive species are identified on site by CSP or by the working group they will be treated or removed as early as possible. 21. Monitor representative large and small Brand’s phacelia populations every year for the duration of this agreement and monitor for new populations in suitable habitat areas (e.g., the ocean side of Silver Strand State Beach). If the distribution of Brand’s phacelia expands beyond its current known distribution at NBC, additional occurrences will be managed to the extent feasible, in accordance with this CCA. 22. Work with visitor service and facilities maintenance staff to minimize significant adverse effects from recreational activities and ongoing site maintenance to existing occurrences of Brand’s phacelia and to its habitat. The CSP Environmental Scientist (ES) will provide SSSB park staff with the most recent GIS layers for Brand’s phacelia. 23. To the greatest extent feasible, provide access and support studies/scientific research specific to the biology and ecology of Brand’s phacelia at SSSB. 24. Continue the plant propagation program. Amplify seed for supplementation of small populations or development of new populations. 25. Monitor Brand’s phacelia occupied and adjacent habitat for invasive plants. Spraying in or near populations of Brand’s phacelia will be evaluated on a site-specific and herbicidedependent basis prior to application to alleviate negative impact to the species and its potential pollinators and non-target, native vegetation. 26. Interpretive signs and public education will be provided. Fencing will be installed (either temporary or permanent) as necessary to support Brand’s phacelia conservation efforts. 27. Manage special events to the extent feasible to avoid large off-pavement events on the bayside between germination of plants and seed maturity (approximately November through April). Special event leaders will be provided educational material about rare plant conservation efforts at SSSB at the beginning of the event. 28. Notify Cooperating Agencies and/or the Working Group of future projects with the potential to affect Brand’s phacelia. U.S. Customs and Border Protection 29. Provide invasive species control on an annual basis within the portion of Lichty Mesa supporting Brand’s phacelia. Invasive species which may be selected for removal include Saharan mustard, devil’s thorn, and crown daisy, smooth cat’s ear, crystalline iceplant, red brome, Pampas grass, and Mediterranean grass. Native species that are not considered part of the local native flora at this location and could be considered for removal include sealavender, California broom, saltbush, giant coreopsis, and purple needlegrass. 30. Monitor all known Brand’s phacelia populations every year for the duration of this agreement and monitor for new populations in suitable habitat areas. If the distribution of Brand’s phacelia expands beyond its current known distribution at Lichty Mesa, additional occurrences will be managed to the extent feasible, in accordance with this CCA. 31.
