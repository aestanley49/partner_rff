Calochortus persistens,SISKIYOU MARIPOSA LILY,,,,,,,1,2,Conservation Agreement,"USFS,BLM",,,,2,,"USFS,BLM","All Agencies agree to: ? Actively seek outside sources of funding and cooperate in cost sharing of habitat improvement projects, monitoring, long-term studies and similar actions specific to this Conservation Agreement, as funding allows. ? Coordinate as needed, to review and document activities conducted under this agreement, including new activities that are initiated as a result of adaptive management, and produce monitoring reports that will include the following: ? A review of each agency’s management actions that have been completed as part of this Conservation Agreement, Calochortus persistens (Siskiyou mariposa lily) Conservation Agreement 21 ? A review of the effectiveness of those management actions to reduce threats to the species, ? A review of the overall site conditions and status of the species, and ? A review of any new information. ? Initiate new actions (i.e., adaptively manage) based on the results of monitoring program review and interagency coordination. ? Conduct National Environmental Policy Act analysis for conservation actions, as appropriate. ? Secure a long-term research partner to conduct research and address conservation needs discussed in this Conservation Agreement. The USFS agrees to: Reduce or remove existing threats to Calochortus persistens habitat on USFS lands. A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range 1) Competition with Nonnative Invasive Weeds ? Survey plant population areas in order to determine where Isatis tinctoria and any other noxious weed species occur. ? Design and implement test plots to monitor the effect of different weed removal treatments (i.e., pulling, cutting, and herbicides) on I. tinctoria density. ? Implement weed removal treatments along roads, in fuel breaks, around communication sites, and in other areas adjacent to the existing Calochortus persistens populations in order to reduce the invasion pressure of weeds on the habitat. ? Using the results of the test plots, analyze and implement weed removal treatments within C. persistens populations that will most effectively reduce I. tinctoria density, while not damaging C. persistens plants. ? Conduct a greenhouse study to determine whether I. tinctoria inhibits C. persistens reproduction and whether there is competition between I. tinctoria and C. persistens seedlings. Calochortus persistens (Siskiyou mariposa lily) Conservation Agreement 22 2) Fire Suppression and Succession ? Conduct field and aerial photograph studies to determine if shrub and conifer encroachment has occurred within Calochortus persistens habitat. ? If encroachment appears to be occurring, plan and conduct prescribed burn tests or small conifer hand-removal projects in those areas. ? Continue to coordinate with CAL FIRE to protect C. persistens in the State Responsibility Area agreement. ? Plan and implement fuel reduction test plots within portions of C. persistens habitat that will reduce the risk of high-intensity fire, shading, and competition. Continue prescribed burning if tests show it creates suitable habitat that is being colonized by C. persistens plants. Discontinue prescribed fire if tests show that this type of disturbance increases the density of Isatis tinctoria or other weeds. 3) Communication Site Construction, Maintenance, and Use ? Coordinate with Mahogany Point and Gunsight Peak Communication Site facility managers and tenants to ensure that communication site plan provisions to protect Calochortus persistens and manage noxious weeds are implemented. ? Coordinate with Gunsight Peak permittees to develop noxious weed management and operating plans; and to implement these plans along with Provision L, Protection of Habitat of Endangered, Threatened, and Sensitive Species; as required by the Gunsight Peak Special Use Permit. ? Coordinate with PPL to explore noxious weed treatment options in the transmission line right-of-way on Gunsight-Humbug Ridge and review methods to protect C. persistens plants from damage or destruction during maintenance operations. ? Explore the possibility of amending the two current authorizing permits for the PPL transmission line to include provisions for noxious weed management and protection of C. persistens plants during maintenance operations. ? When they expire, amend the two PPL transmission line operation authorizing permits to include provisions for noxious weed management and protection of C. persistens plants. 4) OHV and Other Recreational Use ? Survey and map all the existing OHV routes in order to determine where soil compaction within occupied Calochortus persistens habitat is occurring. ? Participate in the current OHV planning effort to avoid OHV use in the C. persistens Special Habitat Management Area. ? Install barriers and routing devices, where necessary, to prevent damage to C. persistens habitat. 5) Other Potential Management Impacts ? Maintain the existing roads in a manner that prevents weed invasion and minimizes damage to Calochortus persistens and its suitable habitat. Calochortus persistens (Siskiyou mariposa lily) Conservation Agreement 23 ? In timber stands adjacent to the C. persistens Special Habitat Management Area or occupied habitat in the Cottonwood Peak and Little Cottonwood Peak C. persistens population localities, design any proposed ground-disturbing activities in a manner that will prevent spread of Isatis tinctoria. C. Disease or predation ? Explore opportunities to design and implement a long-term monitoring plan (greater than 10 years) to determine the agent of herbivory on leaf and reproductive parts and whether herbivory significantly affects species viability. D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms ? The existing regulatory mechanisms allow for conservation of the species. The prioritization of available funds needs to be elevated so that the conservations actions listed in the implementation schedule can be accomplished. E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence ? Explore opportunities to design and implement a long-term (greater than 10 years) quantitative monitoring or demographic study to investigate the population dynamics of the species, including the pollination mechanism, seed viability and germination rate, and survival and mortality rates of the different life stages (seedling, juvenile, and adult). ? Explore opportunities to design and implement a long-term (greater than 10 years) monitoring study to determine the effects of the threats listed above, including Isatis tinctoria or any other noxious weed invasion, herbivory, shrub and conifer encroachment, and prescribed fire to the population dynamics of the species. Determine which of these threats can be ameliorated by land management actions. Monitoring As funding allows, design and implement a comprehensive monitoring plan to establish a current baseline for the size of the Calochortus persistens populations and for the extent and nature of existing threats. The monitoring plan also will be designed to test the effectiveness of different types of treatments used to improve C. persistens habitat and species viability and to address knowledge gaps. Monitoring will be conducted as needed, including monitoring of the effects of OHV and other recreational activities. a.) Baseline population size and demography Conduct an initial survey to map populations and determine existing population sizes and repeat this survey as needed. This initial survey has been completed and will serve as the baseline upon which to measure the effects of different habitat improvement projects that are employed in the future. Calochortus persistens (Siskiyou mariposa lily) Conservation Agreement 24 Baseline population levels were established from 2003 monitoring data for USFS lands on Gunsight-Humbug Ridge and 2007 data for USFS lands on Cottonwood and Little Cottonwood Peaks. A second monitoring survey was conducted on Gunsight-Humbug Ridge in 2009. b.) Isatis tinctoria encroachment Map the existing extent and severity of Isatis tinctoria encroachment periodically, or as changes occur, or if projects may affect habitat to guide weed treatment efforts. c.) Shrub and conifer encroachment Every five years, determine whether Calochortus persistens plants or conifers and shrubs have become established in areas that have been treated by prescribed fire or other fuel reduction methods. d.) OHV and other recreational impacts Periodically conduct surveys for impacts associated with OHV trespass in designated area closures. e.)

Have primary responsibility for implementation of specific conservation actions to protect and restore Arizona bugbane habitat and ensure that viable populations are maintained throughout its natural range on National Forest System lands. 1a. Monitor recreational use on selected high-use dates at Workman Creek and Lower West Fork sites. Map and monitor informal trail development within these populations. At any time, identify impacts which may result in the long-term detriment to the species, or compromise the viability of the site. Decisions regarding recreational use in the areas will be re-evaluated in order to reduce or remove these impacts. 1b. Decrease impacts of recreational activities that relate to long-term detriment to the species, or which compromise the viability of the site. Trails will be re-routed as necessary to reduce trampling of plants or soils. No new trails will be constructed within 100 feet of existing Arizona bugbane plants. 1c. Manage ungulate grazing and browsing so there is no long-term detriment to the species, nor compromising of the viability of the site. Long-term detriment will vary according to the attributes of each site, and will be determined by monitoring and coordination between the Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service. Verify and maintain integrity of pasture fencing prior to livestock use of pastures near or containing Arizona bugbane. 1d. Provide appropriate buffers around timber harvest activities to maintain Arizona bugbane population integrity. Provide adjacent habitat sufficient to maintain the appropriate microenvironments for the species. 2. Conduct detailed monitoring (level 1) at each selected site as identified in the Forests' strategies (Bill Williams, James Canyon, Maple Springs, Upper West Fork, West Clear Creek, Workman Creek) every five years, on a rotating schedule. Monitor all other populations with broad sampling methods every five years, to be implemented on a rotating schedule. At Workman Creek and Lower West Fork, broad sampling protocol will be implemented each year when detailed monitoring is not done. 3. The corrected Kaibab National Forest Land Management Plan will be amended to incorporate the Standards and Guidelines outlined in the Arizona bugbane Conservation Assessment and Strategy on the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests for the Bill Williams Botanical Area (Management Area 6). After the new population in the Saddle Mountain Wilderness (Ecological Management Area 19) is inventoried and assessed, any additions or changes to the Kaibab National Forest Land Management Plan will be addressed, if necessary. Initiate incorporation of Standards and Guidelines outlined in Tonto National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan as soon as strategy is completed. 4. Evaluate establishment of special management areas such as Botanical Areas or Research Natural Areas, especially for Workman Creek. 5. Prepare Biological Assessments and Evaluations to determine effects of planned projects within existing populations or potential habitat of Arizona bugbane Retain Arizona bugbane as a Regional and Forest sensitive species. 6. Fully involve the Fish and Wildlife Service and appropriate State agencies as cooperators or partners throughout the National Environmental Policy Act process for all projects likely to affect Arizona bugbane or its habitat. 7. Determine the extent of Arizona bugbane on Bill Williams Mountain and North Canyon, in the Sierra Ancha Mountains, and in the Oak Creek and West Clear Creek population areas, and conduct surveys in other areas of potential habitat. 8. Evaluate opportunities for conservation easementsand/orland acquisition of additional important private inholdings of Arizona bugbane populations, if any become known. 9. Support studies and other scientific research to better understand the biology and ecology of the Arizona bugbane 10. Implement additional actions as detailed for the Coconino and Kaibab National Forests in tables 4 and 5 of their Conservation Assessment and Strategy, and for the Tonto National Forest within the action plan of their conservation assessment. Complete all appropriate National Environmental Policy Act compliance documentation. /// U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Shall: 1. Provide technical assistance in the implementation of this Conservation Agreement and ensure adequate protection and management is occurring. 2. Assess listing Arizona bugbane under the Endangered Species Act if implementation of this agreement is not occurring, or if the conservation measures prove to be inadequate to protect the species or its habitat. Listing would follow the normal rulemaking process. 3. Become fully involved throughout the NEPA progress for all projects likely to affect Arizona bugbane or its habitat (reference #6 above). /// C. U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Shall: 1. Work together to implement the Arizona Bugbane Conservation Agreement, to manage, protect, and restore the ecosystems upon which the Arizona bugbane and other species depend. 2.

This report will be provided to the NBC Natural Resources staff by October 15; b. The NBC Natural Resources staff will consolidate these reports into one submission to the Service for review by November 15. 2. Cooperating agencies will establish and participate in a Brand’s Phacelia Working Group consisting of their staff (or designated representatives), the Service, and biologists involved in conducting surveys, if available. Working Group participants will meet annually to: a. provide site-specific updates on the status of the plants and habitat management; b. evaluate ongoing management strategies for Brand’s phacelia and assess the effectiveness of implementation of the Conservation Action Items to date; and c. discuss and develop additional management strategies that the landowners could choose to implement as part of an adaptive management approach, should management to date appear insufficient or should a different approach to management be indicated. - - - - - Agency-Specific Commitments::: Naval Base Coronado::: 5. Management in the INRMP will be designed to avoid actions which may cause a species to become threatened or endangered. In addition to those species listed as threatened or endangered under the Act, or that are candidates for such listing, the U.S. Navy has recognized the need to implement special management direction for other rare species on the lands it administers. 6. Fund weed control, dune restoration, and habitat enhancement on an annual basis to monitor and treat as needed any plant that poses a threat to the continued success of Brand’s phacelia. Invasive species funding will be targeted for the removal of iceplant to promote the expansion of Brand’s phacelia beyond the baseline population level in areas not used for training. 7. Monitor all known Brand’s phacelia populations every year for the duration of this agreement and monitor for new populations in suitable habitat areas [e.g., SSTC-South and Naval Outlying Landing Field Imperial Beach (NOLF IB)]. If the distribution of Brand’s phacelia expands beyond its current known distribution at NBC, additional occurrences will be managed to the extent feasible, in accordance with this CCA. 8. Ensure that mowing within occupied habitat at NAS North Island continues in a manner which minimizes effects to Brand’s phacelia. 9. To the greatest extent feasible, work with the Navy operators to conduct all activities associated with military operations (including maintenance) in a manner that minimizes adverse effects to existing populations and perhaps promotes Brand’s phacelia populations. The NBC Installation Botanist will: a. provide military operators and schedulers the most recent GIS layers for Brand’s phacelia distribution. When possible, plant locations will be considered in conducting training events; and b. coordinate with military operators to reduce the risk of invasion of nonnative plants and noxious weeds in Brand’s phacelia habitat areas. 10.

Upon execution of this Agreement by each of the signatory parties, the following guidelines, developed from the Mississippi Army National Guard’s Integrated Natural and Cultural Resources Management Plan (2001), the U.S. Forest Service’s Final Environmental Impact Statement for Vegetative Management in the Coastal Plain/Piedmont (1989), and the U.S. Forest Service’s Forest Plan for the National Forests in Mississippi (1987), will be immediately implemented in wetland areas known to be occupied by CSBC: · A 100-foot protective buffer will be posted around occupied wetlands, and vehicles*, equipment*, off-road vehicles, livestock (horses), and pesticides will be prohibited within the buffer. · Fire breaks, fire lanes, or ditches will not be constructed through the occupied wetlands. · Timber harvesting in occupied wetlands will be limited to the removal of planted slash pines (see Habitat Management, below). · Occupied wetlands will not be replanted with trees. · No applications of herbicides will occur within occupied wetlands or their buffers except for treatment of noxious invasive weeds (e.g., cogon grass) using aquatic-labeled herbicides with prior approval by the CSBC Team (see Section XI, below). *Activities within the posted buffers that have been previously approved under the Environmental Impact Statement for the Camp Shelby Special Use Permit Area on National Forest Land (i.e., existing and future firing ranges requiring limited periodic maintenance for line of sight, or ephemeral wetland crossings for tracked and wheeled armor on Combined Arms Area ranges) may be conducted upon development and approval of maintenance protocols and/or mitigation requirements by the CSBC Team (see Section XI, below). Responsible Party: USFS, MSNG. 2. Within 6 months of the parties’ signing of this Agreement, all existing ATV trails through wetlands currently known to be occupied by CSBC will be blocked and posted. Responsible Party: USFS, MSNG. 3. Prior to any construction, timber harvesting, or military training activities within pitcher plant wetlands in the upper Cypress Creek or Beaumont Creek watersheds, surveys will be conducted by the responsible Party to determine the presence or absence of CSBC in wetland areas. If CSBC are present, the Measures identified under Section X.A.1, above, will be implemented. Responsible Party: USFS, MSNG. B. HABITAT MANAGEMENT Wetlands are currently managed and protected to some degree by both USFS (1989, 1987) and MSNG (2001). Upon execution of this Agreement by the signatory parties, the following management actions will be implemented in CSBC occupied wetlands: · Fire management: wetlands will be burned every 2 to 3 years during the growing season, beginning in 2004, weather permitting. Responsible Party: USFS. · Erosion control: silviculture and military training activities in uplands draining into CSBC wetlands will employ erosion Best Management Practices (BMPs); existing erosion problems near wetlands will be repaired. Responsible Party: USFS, MSNG. · Hydrology: natural hydrological flow from adjacent uplands into CSBC habitats will be maintained. Responsible Party: USFS, MSNG. · Restoration: slash pines will be removed from overgrown wetland areas where there are currently low densities of CSBC. Responsible Party: USFS. · Timber management: slash pine removal will be by chainsaw when the soil is dry. Where possible, cut pines will be scattered at the site. If mechanical removal of trees is required, it will be monitored by a representative of MSNG or USFS to ensure minimal soil disturbance and compaction. Responsible Party: USFS. C. MONITORING Monitoring is an essential component of any conservation strategy and plan. However, as noted previously, CSBC live in subterranean burrows and are difficult to quantify. The presence of any species of burrowing crayfish, including the CSBC, is easily established in wetlands by the presence of burrow “chimneys.” However, in order to identify the species of crayfish making the burrow, it is usually necessary to excavate the burrow. Although CSBC burrows may have one to four chimneys, and may be occupied by one or more individuals, the presence and density of burrows is a nondestructive measurement of crayfish response to management. CSBC are most abundant in open, high quality pitcher plant wetlands. Therefore, vegetation monitoring will also be an effective tool in assessing the health of the community and the CSBC, and the effectiveness of habitat management. Within three months of execution of this Agreement by the signatory parties, a CSBC/vegetation monitoring plan will be developed and submitted to all parties  for approval. Upon approval of the monitoring plan, an initial burrow census will be conducted in areas known to be inhabited by CSBC. Vegetation baseline data will also be developed for each site. Annual monitoring of selected habitats will be conducted during the initial term of this Agreement (see Section XII, below). Monitoring sites will be identified by the CSBC Conservation Team established in Section XI, below. Periodic limited excavation will be conducted to establish that CSBC is the species constructing burrows in the wetlands. Annual monitoring reports will be submitted to all parties by January 1 of each year. Responsible Party: USFS, MSNG. Census/monitoring techniques will be modified as information is developed. D. EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TRANSFER Awareness can promote higher levels of environmental stewardship and protection for the CSBC and its habitat. Activities within the areas occupied by the species include silviculture, troop training, hunting, and sport riding. Within one year of the execution of this Agreement by the signatory parties, educational materials describing pitcher plant wetlands, and the unique presence of CSBC and other sensitive species will be developed and distributed to targeted audiences, including the National Guard, loggers, and ATV users.

Protection of Species of Concern: To conserve and protect species of concern and the ecosystem on which they depend within the western Mojave Desert. 2. Provide Equity in Regulation: To provide a comprehensive means to coordinate and standardize mitigation and compensation requirements so that public and private actions will be regulated equally and consistently, reducing delays, expenses, and regulatory duplication. It is intended that the Plan will eliminate uncertainty in developing private projects and will prescribe a system to ensure that the costs of compensation/mitigation are applied equitably to all agencies and parties. 3. Reduce Cumulative Impacts: To prescribe mitigation measures for private development and agency actions to lessen or avoid cumulative impacts to the species of concern and eliminate, whenever possible, case-by-case review of impacts of projects when consistent with the mitigation and compensation requirements prescribed by the Plan.

Conservation Efforts Many public and private landowners have been working to manage Georgia aster, and improvements are continually being made in population size and vigor. A few examples of work to conserve the Georgia aster by Parties to the Agreement and other landowners are highlighted below. Georgia Department of Natural Resources Oaky Woods Wildlife Management Area in Georgia has used prescribed fires to help manage for this species. Georgia aster (one patch with five flowering-stems) was discovered on the largest prairie remnant in October 2006. Regular winter and early growing season burns every 1 to 3 years on the Georgia aster prairie since 2007 greatly enhanced the prairie. In 2012 the small patch had increased to more than 80 flowering stems in a 30 by 10 m area and several new patches have now been found on other parts of the prairie habitat (Tom Patrick, GA DNR, pers. comm. 2013). National Park Service The Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area in Georgia annually monitors the populations that grow in the park. In coordination with GDOT, plants were rescued from a road-widening site within the park in 2012 and planted near a parking lot which is maintained via weed-trimming in winter months. This site now has 256 stems showing good viability (Read and Pierson 2012). State Departments of Transportation In Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, populations have been relocated in advance of road improvement activities that would have destroyed or modified Georgia aster habitat. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Cooperators In order to answer questions that would help determine if Georgia aster is warranted for listing, in September 2010, the USFS and USFWS allocated funds toward a rangewide assessment of seed viability and population genetic structure in Georgia aster. This project involved collaborators from the Atlanta Botanical Garden, the North Carolina Botanical Garden, the State Botanical Garden of Georgia, and The Citadel. The projects were completed in early 2013. They provided information on the levels of genetic diversity within populations while also examining correlations between population size and genetic diversity and seed production. Research results are discussed in the Habitat/Life History section below. This work helped with the formation of the CCA conservation strategy. U.S. Forest Service The USFS has been thinning woody vegetation, using prescribed burns and non-native invasive species treatments to manage for Georgia aster on national forest land. This management work has aided many populations on the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia. As of 2013, about 5000 stems of Georgia aster from 9 populations grow on the Chattahoochee National Forest. The Chattahoochee National Forest is also working with partners on propagation and out-planting (Joanne Baggs, USFS, pers. comm. 2013). The Talladega National Forest contains Alabama’s largest population (~4000 individuals). In 2008, the Talladega National Forest thinned longleaf pine stands to savannah conditions specifically to aid the Georgia aster population. The Talladega National Forest is partnering with Auburn University to grow and plant ~2000 Georgia aster seedlings (Gary Shurette, USFS, pers. comm. 2013). The Uwharrie National Forest in North Carolina reduced the basal area of an oak-hickory forest adjacent to a Georgia aster population from 100 ft2 to less than 40 ft2 in 2002. This area was burned in 2003 with the fireline constructed next to the original Georgia aster population of 60 stems which grew along a fenceline. This population expanded into the fireline by 2004 and stem counts in 2010 and 2011 indicated a 25-fold increase from 1998 counts (Gary Kauffman, USFS, pers. comm. 2013). Over 7000 individuals of Georgia aster from twelve populations grow on the Sumter National Forest in South Carolina. Sumter National Forest is working with propagation, out-planting and using prescribed-fire and woody vegetation thinning to increase Georgia aster population size where it grows on the forest (Robin Mackie, USFS, pers. comm. 2013).",https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/plan_documents/tcca/tcca_1209.pdf,,,,,,,,,,

The Village of Cloudcroft will share in the cost of public outreach and education. Otero County Through the CPR program, Otero County is expected to contribute $100,000 towards threatened and endangered species and the butterfly. Specifically, the County has allocated this funding in the category of science and monitoring. Forest Service Estimated costs incurred by the Forest Service associated with the butterfly efforts since 2001 have been approximately $100,000. The Forest Service will continue to allocate resources towards coordination with the USFWS on butterfly conservation. The Forest Service has conducted a biological study of the butterfly between 1999-2003 which was completed at a cost of $30,000. The Forest Service will continue to fund surveys and monitoring activities. In addition, the Lincoln National Forest has received $750,000 from the USDA to conduct forest restoration and community protection projects on the forest that will benefit the butterfly by broadening meadow habitats and clearing encroaching trees to create potential dispersal corridors. Fish and Wildlife Service The USFWS procured $13,200 for an initial research study of the effects of habitat variables, wild ungulate grazing, and gophers on the checkerspot butterfly in 2005. In addition, the USFWS procured an additional $7,300 to investigate the butterfly’s metapopulation structure for the summer of 2006. Using maps of occupied butterfly habitat prepared by the Forest Service, this study collected field data over the summer of 2005 in six canyons, three of which contain the butterfly and three that do not. Ecological variables of occupied and unoccupied canyons will be compared and interactions among the butterfly, its host plants, wild grazers, and gophers will be analyzed. At each canyon, data concerning adult and larval butterfly demographics, host and nectar plants, percent ground cover, soil characteristics, topography, and climate will be recorded. In particular, butterfly larval and adult densities and wild ungulate impacts will be compared to formulate adaptive grazing regimes that will benefit the butterfly. The Sacramento Mountains checkerspot butterfly is currently a priority for the USFWS’s Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program. This program has been working diligently with the Forest Service and non-Federal entities regarding conservation efforts related to the butterfly. For example, the Forest Service gathered P. neomexicanus seeds from sites on the Lincoln National Forest. During 2003 and 2004, the Plant Materials Center in Los Lunas, New Mexico, in cooperation with the National Resource Conservation Service, cleaned, graded, and planted P. neomexicanus seed. The Otero County Chapter of the Native Plant Society of New Mexico and the Otero County Extension Office (Master Gardener Program) have expressed interest in being “foster parents” for Penstemon plants until they are needed for community projects. In addition, these entities would like to be advocates in the community for the butterfly and its larval and nectar plants, as well as being “on-call” to assist with relocating and transplanting plants during Forest Service activities. The USFWS will continue to seek resources and funding for research, monitoring, and surveys. In addition, the USFWS will continue to allocate resources towards coordination with the partners on butterfly conservation.",https://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/NewMexico/documents/SMCB_Final_11_1_05.pdf,MOU attached as Appendix A at end of document,5,"USFWS regional office, USFWS Ecological services New Mexico Field Office, USFS, Village of Cloudcroft",Pdf pages 78-80,at end of document,,,,,

SUMMARY OF CONSERVATION STRATEGY Through the SCP, the CDFW has required Newhall Land to provide for the perpetual conservation and management of seven spineflower preserves, totaling 228 acres, located within the SCP Enrolled Lands on Newhall Land property and depicted on Exhibit D to this CCA. The SCP spineflower preserves contain approximately three-quarters of the cumulative occupied spineflower habitat on Newhall Land property, totaling approximately 15.4 acres, in addition to land targeted for spineflower expansion and buffer areas intended to protect spineflower occurrence locations from development-related threats. The SCP spineflower preserves are connected to a larger system of open space and habitat, totaling approximately 10,000 acres that will be permanently conserved through implementation of the SCP and the Newhall Ranch RMDP. Newhall Land has granted conservation easements to the CDFW over all of the SCP spineflower preserves. The SCP Conservation Measures include habitat enhancement and creation measures for spineflower, and experimental introduction of spineflower in areas outside of existing occupied habitat. Newhall Land has already provided more than $4 million in endowments to fund management and monitoring of the SCP spineflower preserves, and will provide approximately $2 million more in SCP endowments as required by the ITP. Newhall Land has also provided an endowment of approximately $1.15 million under the SCP for perpetual management of the spineflower population at the former Ahmanson Ranch property, now called the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve. Together, the SCP Enrolled Lands and the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve contain and conserve both known extant populations of the spineflower. The Additional Conservation Areas are intended to further increase the distribution of the spineflower within its historic range and include approximately 1,498 acres: (1) three Additional Conservation Areas totaling approximately 825 acres are contiguous with or adjacent to the existing San Martinez Grande and Potrero spineflower preserves established under the SCP (all of which would be considered part of the Santa Clarita population); (2) an Additional Conservation Area of 357 acres is located in the Simi Valley watershed on the southern boundary of Newhall Land property in Ventura County; (3) an Additional Conservation Area of approximately 316 acres is located on Newhall Land property in the Castaic Mesa area in northern Los Angeles County, near a known extirpated population location; and (4) an Additional Conservation Area containing spineflower introduction sites is located in a portion of the Petersen Ranch Mitigation Bank adjacent to Elizabeth Lake, also near a known extirpated population location.3 In carrying out the Additional Conservation Measures as described in the Introduction Plan, Newhall Land will introduce spineflower within portions of the Additional Conservation Areas with the goal of establishing at least two new self-sustaining and persistent spineflower occurrences—at least one of which will be in a different ecoregion from the existing populations. Spineflower introduction will occur on a total of at least 10 acres within the Additional Conservation Areas. Newhall Land will also cause permanent conservation instruments to be recorded over each of the Additional Conservation Areas to ensure that spineflower habitat values are maintained.4 Newhall Land will fund all initial habitat enhancement and spineflower introduction activities within the Additional Conservation Areas, estimated at approximately $3.35 million, and will fund one or more endowments to provide perpetual management and monitoring within the Additional Conservation Areas, based on a Property Analysis Record, currently estimated at a total of approximately $4.1 million. 4. PURPOSE AND GOALS The purpose of this CCA is to provide for the implementation of the Introduction Plan and Additional Conservation Measures therein to enhance the status of spineflower populations. The Additional Conservation Measures will: x Increase the understanding of spineflower habitat requirements and life history characteristics so that population expansion and augmentation can be achieved; x Provide for expansion of existing spineflower occurrence locations and targeted introduction of spineflower in suitable habitat at additional locations within the Additional Conservation Areas, establishing at least two new self-sustaining and persistent spineflower occurrences. x Implement an adaptive management program for the introduced populations that will include enhancement, maintenance, and monitoring efforts with the intent to continue conservation efforts in perpetuity. The goal of this CCA is to contribute to ensuring that the spineflower is not in danger of extinction or likely to become so within the foreseeable future, by expanding the scope of measures to prevent, reduce and eliminate threats to the spineflower, and by increasing the number and geographic range of the species to increase its resiliency, redundancy, and representation.",https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/plan_documents/tcca/tcca_2254.pdf,,,,,

Similarly, it is recognized by all Parties that APGI’s specific responsibilities with regard to the Yadkin River goldenrod are described by and limited to the terms of the FERC Project license and this Agreement. This Agreement is subject to and is intended to be consistent with all applicable Federal and State laws. à B. Conservation Actions The following conservation actions are specific to the Project Site, and the responsible parties are identified for each. At the direction of the USFWS and NCPCP, APGI will conduct annual control of invasive exotic species, which include Albizia julibrissin (Mimosa), bush honeysuckle (Lonicera x bella), privet (Ligustrum sinense) and Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) at the Project Site. APGI will continue to maintain signs below Narrows Dam to discourage recreationists from entering the tailwaters area and trampling the plant. By separate agreement, APGI will provide NCPCP and USFWS personnel access to its property for the sole purposes established by this Agreement including monitoring the Yadkin River goldenrod at its existing sites. APGI, its contractors, the USFWS, and NCPCP, will conduct annual monitoring to include standardized enumeration of stems and rosettes (Bates 2005) combined with georeferenced maps/photographs. The USFWS and NCPCP will continue to explore opportunities to harvest and spread seed to suitable habitat in and near the existing population.",https://www.fws.gov/asheville/pdfs/Yadkin-River-Goldenrod_CCA_07-12-2013.pdf,,,,,,,,,,
